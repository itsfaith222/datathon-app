## Current SDG 3 alignment

Your app supports SDG 3 in these ways:

### Strong connections

1. Target 3.4 — Reduce premature mortality from non-communicable diseases:
   - Helps users avoid allergens that can cause severe reactions
   - Supports dietary management for conditions like diabetes, heart disease, and celiac

2. Target 3.9 — Reduce deaths from hazardous chemicals:
   - Identifies harmful ingredients in food products
   - Prevents exposure to allergens and restricted substances

3. Prevention and health awareness:
   - Promotes informed food choices
   - Helps prevent health emergencies from allergic reactions

### Areas to strengthen SDG 3 alignment

1. Nutrition information display (Target 3.4):
   - Show calories, sugar, sodium, fat, protein, vitamins
   - Add daily value percentages
   - Highlight high/low nutrient content
   - You already load nutrition datasets but don’t display them

2. Health impact metrics (Target 3.4):
   - Track daily/weekly nutrition goals
   - Show health score or rating per product
   - Visualize trends over time
   - Calculate health impact (e.g., “This week you avoided X allergens”)

3. Educational content (Target 3.4):
   - Explain why certain ingredients are flagged
   - Provide tips for healthier alternatives
   - Link to health resources

4. Broader health tracking (Target 3.4):
   - Connect to chronic disease management (diabetes, hypertension)
   - Track specific nutrients relevant to conditions
   - Provide personalized recommendations

5. Data visualization for social good (Target 3.4):
   - Aggregate, anonymized insights (e.g., “Most common allergens in your area”)
   - Community health trends
   - Contribute to public health data

## Recommendations to enhance SDG 3 impact

### High priority

1. Display nutrition facts:
   - Use the nutrition datasets you already load
   - Show a nutrition facts panel with key metrics
   - Add color coding (green/yellow/red) for health indicators

2. Health score system:
   - Calculate a health score per product (0–100)
   - Factor in: allergens avoided, nutrition quality, ingredient safety
   - Track average health score over time

3. Daily health dashboard:
   - Show today’s scanned items summary
   - Track nutrients consumed
   - Display health achievements

### Medium priority

4. Educational tooltips:
   - Explain why ingredients are flagged
   - Provide health information about allergens
   - Suggest healthier alternatives

5. Health goals tracking:
   - Set daily nutrition goals
   - Track progress toward health objectives
   - Celebrate milestones

### For social good impact

6. Aggregate analytics (anonymized):
   - Show community-level insights
   - Identify common allergens in your region
   - Contribute to public health understanding

7. SDG 3 impact statement:
   - Add a section explaining how the app supports SDG 3
   - Show user impact metrics (e.g., “You’ve avoided 15 potential allergic reactions this month”)

## Quick wins to implement

1. Add nutrition facts display using existing datasets
2. Create a health score calculation
3. Add an SDG 3 impact section to the UI
4. Display daily health summary

Should I implement any of these? I can start with the nutrition facts display and health score, which would strengthen the SDG 3 connection.
